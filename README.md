# Andrea Bonvicin
**Cycling Performance Coach & Data Scientist**

I work on the analysis of cycling training and racing data using Python and other tools.  
My work focuses on race recap automation, effort and sprint detection, test comparison, and advanced analysis of training periods.

I develop reproducible workflows and custom models to support performance evaluation and longitudinal monitoring.
